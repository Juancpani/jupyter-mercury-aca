# Jupyter Notebooks Rendered with Mercury on Azure Container Apps

An Azure Developer CLI (azd) template that renders runnable Jupyter Notebooks in the browser using Mercury. This template uses Azure Container Apps to host the application on Azure. It includes:
- Application code (really just a sample Jupyter Notebook)
- Infrastructure as Code assets, written in Bicep, that provision Azure resources and specify how to deploy the code on Azure

## Prerequisites
- Azure Developer CLI
- Python 3.9+
- Docker

## Quickstart

The fastest way for you to get this application up and running on Azure is to use the `azd up` command. This single command will create and configure all necessary Azure resources - including access policies and roles for your account and service-to-service communication with Managed Identities.

1. Open a terminal, create a new empty folder, and change into it.
2. Create a new Python virtual environment.
3. Run the following command to initialize the project, provision Azure resources, and deploy the application code.

```
azd up --template savannahostrowski/python-jupyter-azd
```

## How to modify this template
In the `src/` directory, you'll find two sample notebook - one generated by Mercury that demos its capabilities and the other `Titanic.ipynb` file (written by my pal [Claudia](https://github.com/claudiaregio/data-science)). You can remove these file and replace it with your own Jupyter notebook(s).

If you want to make your notebooks interactive, you can check out the Mercury documentation (you just need to add a cell with a bit of YAML in it).

The template's requirements.txt includes various Python packages that support both the core app working (largely just Mercury and its dependencies) and dependencies to run the notebooks. You'll want to install any dependencies you need to run your notebooks in your virtual environment.
